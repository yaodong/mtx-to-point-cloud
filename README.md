# Matrix Market to Point Cloud

This is a script to convert a Matrix Market file to a point cloud coordinates file.

## How to use

The first thing you make sure you have installed Python 3.x. My development environment is 3.6.0.

Then, install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`. To convert a file, run with

```
python mtx-to-point-cloud.py your-file-name.mtx
```

It generates a text file contains coordinates of points.
